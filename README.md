### Highlighted Projects & Publications

#### Publication: McAlester J, Kanazawa Y (2022) Situating zoonotic diseases in peacebuilding and development theories: Prioritizing zoonoses in Jordan. PLOS ONE 17(3): e0265508. https://doi.org/10.1371
- **Description**: Developed a modified CDC One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Tool to identify and prioritize zoonotic diseases in Jordan, with a focus on refugee populations and peace-building strategies. Conducted logistic regression and confirmatory factor analysis using R and Excel to inform targeted capacity-building and resource allocation. Promoted cross-sector collaboration through data-driven insights to support public health planning and policy.
- **Technologies / Methods Used**: R/R Studio, Excel, logistic regression, confirmatory factor analysis

#### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Using CDCâ€™s 2021 BRFSS
- **Description**: This was a project completed for a data analysis in R course. We were tasked with selecting four variables from The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). My background is working as a nurse practitioner in cardiology. Though risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well known, I was interested in taking the opportunity to personally conduct data analysis regrading this. My overarching question was: what is the relationship between cardiovascular disease and socioeconomic factors such as depression, alcohol consumption, and region. To evaluate this, I will walk us through an exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling of specific variables from the BRFSS dataset.
- **Technologies / Methods Used**: R / R Studio with specific emphasis on package tidyverse and use of dplyr, logistic regression

#### Project 2: Avian Influenza Machine Learning Models: Dealing with Class Imbalance
- **Description**: Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to predict avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks based on bird species, geography, and seasonality. Addressed class imbalance through cross-validation and class weighting, and improved overall performance using an ensemble Voting Classifier. The final model achieved high accuracy, recall, and precision, supporting more effective surveillance and outbreak prevention efforts. Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, ColumnTransformer, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, make_pipeline
- **Technologies / Methods Used**: Jupyter Notebook / Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib & Seaborn, ColumnTransformer, make_pipeline, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder etc...

#### Project 3: Student Performance Prediction Machine Learning Models
- **Description**: Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to deliver real-time insights into key sales KPIs, including regional trends, team performance, and inventory levels. Enabled dynamic data exploration for stakeholders to identify patterns, monitor progress, and drive data-informed decisions.
- **Technologies / Methods Used**: Tableau

  #### Project 4: Student Performance Prediction Machine Learning Models
- **Description**: Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student performance based on key features, enabling early identification of at-risk students for intervention. Utilized Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn to implement models including Linear Regression, SVM Regression, and Lasso Regression. Applied scikit-learn pipelines, custom transformers, and ColumnTransformer for efficient data preprocessing. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation, with the SVM model fine-tuned via GridSearchCV to optimize predictive accuracy.
