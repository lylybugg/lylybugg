#### Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis Using CDCâ€™s 2021 BRFSS
- **Description**: This was a project completed for a data analysis in R course. We were tasked with selecting four variables from The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). My background is working as a nurse practitioner in cardiology. Though risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well known, I was interested in taking the opportunity to personally conduct data analysis regrading this. My overarching question was: what is the relationship between cardiovascular disease and socioeconomic factors such as depression, alcohol consumption, and region. To evaluate this, I will walk us through an exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling of specific variables from the BRFSS dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: R / R Studio with specific emphasis on package tidyverse and use of dplyr.
