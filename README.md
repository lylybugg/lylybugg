### Highlighted Projects & Publications

#### Publication: McAlester J, Kanazawa Y (2022) Situating zoonotic diseases in peacebuilding and development theories: Prioritizing zoonoses in Jordan. PLOS ONE 17(3): e0265508. https://doi.org/10.1371
- **Description**: Publication based on my thesis work for my Masters in Peace Studies. In this article, I expand the One Health framework by situating zoonotic diseases in peacebuilding and development theories in order to prioritize zoonotic diseases in Jordan. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach, I assessed the CDC's 12 previously published One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) tools in order to create a new tool which took into consideratin the impact of COVID-19 and the refugee situation in Jordan. I then used the updated tool to prioritze zoonoss in Jodan, finding the priority zoonoses to be bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, and COVID-19, with most having a disproportionately negative impact on refugees. In Jordanâ€™s case, zoonotic diseases represent an area where promoting social equity for individuals is essential to the larger society. In this sense managing zoonoses is an area uniquely suited for peacebuilding.
- **Technologies Used**: R/R Studio

#### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Using CDCâ€™s 2021 BRFSS
- **Description**: This was a project completed for a data analysis in R course. We were tasked with selecting four variables from The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). My background is working as a nurse practitioner in cardiology. Though risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well known, I was interested in taking the opportunity to personally conduct data analysis regrading this. My overarching question was: what is the relationship between cardiovascular disease and socioeconomic factors such as depression, alcohol consumption, and region. To evaluate this, I will walk us through an exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling of specific variables from the BRFSS dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: R / R Studio with specific emphasis on package tidyverse and use of dplyr.
